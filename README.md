<ul>
    <li>We faced challenges in setting up a call with the emergency contact</li>
    <li>Some deployment issues with WebRTC</li>
    <li>As we had less experience with backend so we were unable to add any database for user authentication</li>
    <li>As Google Map API is paid so we ran into some issues with it too.
</li>
